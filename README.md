### Summary
The Whisky Journal App is a place to keep track of your tasting notes as you sample new whiskies of all types. You can add as much or as little data from your tasting as you want, including:

- The name of the whisk(e)y
- The type (Bourbon, Rye, Scotch, Irish, Japanese, or Other)
- Tasting date
- Age
- Proof
- Pour size (if you tasted it out at a bar or event)
- Bottle size (if you purchased by the bottle)
- Price for the pour or bottle
- Establishment where you purchased or tasted
- Tasting notes, including nose, flavor, and finish
- A personal score out of 100

Whiskies in your list are arranged alphabetically and display your personal score in a tag pill.

### Technologies Used
This full-stack project was built using HTML, CSS, AngularJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Webpack, Passport, bCrypt, Mocha, Chai, npm as a build tool and Travis CI for continuous integration.

### Future Versions

For future versions of this app, I hope to implement the ability to search your list of tasted whiskies by each individual characteristic, as well as by clicking on a tasting note tag on another whiskey. 

Social features such as viewing other users' whiskey lists are a possibility, as well as using other users' establishment data to locate whiskies you'd like to try in your city.
